# DermAItool react application

This app sums up the whole front-end of DermAItool, using boith TailwindCSS aand native approachs for styling.

Currently, the app consists of:

- A REACT functionnal component for each UI element.
- Assets & a Sub-linked "Image repo" to the main image repository in the host machine, cloning it completely, and dynamically chagnging after each tweak in the main one, due to current external image upload bugs in REACT.
